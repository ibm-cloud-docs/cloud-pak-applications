# Uninstalling your workspace or resources

{: shortdesc}

## Before you begin
{: #beforeyouuninstall}

Ensure that you have the IBM Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions that are required for installation. Refer to the [Before you begin](/docs/cloud-pak-applications?topic=cloud-pak-applications-getting-started#prereqs) section of the Getting started page.

## Step 1. Use the Schematic workspace to view your installation of {{site.data.keyword.icpa_short}}

You can view your existing installation of {{site.data.keyword.icpa_short}} in two ways.

1. Log in to cloud.ibm.com.
2. In the menu, click **Schematics**.

5. On the **Create** tab, expand **View the existing installations**.
6. Click the link to the Schematics workspace.

## Step 2. Delete resources and, optionally, the workspace
{: #unstep2}
